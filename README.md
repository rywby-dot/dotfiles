Traditional window managers arrange windows to fit your screen. Stacking compositors do so by piling windows on top of each other; tiling compositors do so by squeezing them to fit and utilizing workspaces.

`driftwm` is an infinite-canvas compositor: windows live at their native size on an infinite 2D canvas, and your display is a camera viewing it. When two windows come close, they snap together, forming implicit groups that can be moved, resized, and viewed together. No tiling, no workspaces, window overlaps happen only on purpose.

Designed with laptops in mind: navigation and window management are trackpad-first; the infinite canvas makes the most of a small screen.

## Features

### Pan & zoom

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f14739-7762-4515-abb1-0de6990de4a3

Infinite 2D canvas with viewport panning, zoom, and scroll momentum. A quick
flick carries the viewport smoothly until friction stops it.

| Input              | Action            | Context   |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------- |
| 3-finger swipe     | Pan viewport      | anywhere  |
| Trackpad scroll    | Pan viewport      | on-canvas |
| `Mod` + LMB drag   | Pan viewport      | anywhere  |
| `Mod+Ctrl` + arrow | Pan viewport      | —         |
| 2-finger pinch     | Zoom              | on-canvas |
| 3-finger pinch     | Zoom              | anywhere  |
| `Mod` + scroll     | Zoom at cursor    | anywhere  |
| `Mod+=` / `Mod+-`  | Zoom in / out     | —         |
| `Mod+0` / `Mod+Z`  | Reset zoom to 1.0 | —         |

### Window navigation

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b7d89cd-b065-4309-ae74-30bfe68a8abb

Jump to the nearest window in any direction via cone search. MRU cycling
(`Alt-Tab`) with hold-to-commit. Zoom-to-fit shows all windows at once.
Configurable anchors act as navigation targets for directional jumps even
with no window there — useful for areas with pinned widgets.

| Input                        | Action                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 4-finger swipe               | Jump to nearest window (natural direction) |
| `Mod+Ctrl` + LMB drag        | Jump to nearest window (natural direction) |
| `Mod` + arrow                | Jump to nearest window in direction        |
| `Alt-Tab` / `Alt-Shift-Tab`  | Cycle windows (MRU)                        |
| 4-finger pinch in / `Mod+W`  | Zoom-to-fit (overview)                     |
| 4-finger pinch out / `Mod+A` | Home toggle (origin and back)              |
| 4-finger hold / `Mod+C`      | Center focused window                      |
| `Mod+1-4`                    | Jump to bookmarked canvas position         |

All 4-finger navigation gestures also work as `Mod` + 3-finger for smaller
trackpads.

### Snapping

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a468e69-8887-4d27-8457-cdd2753948ca

Move window with 3-finger doubletap-swipe or `Alt` + drag. Resize with `Alt` + 3-finger swipe. Snapping kicks in as edges approach each other. Drag past the viewport edge and the canvas auto-pans.

**Snapped windows form a cluster.** Two benefits: neighbors stay visible at your view's edge for spatial context, and `Shift` + any move/resize/fit action acts on the whole cluster. Shuffle a layout in one drag, resize a row of panes proportionally, or scope an overview to just the cluster (`Mod+Shift+W`). No explicit grouping to manage.

> **Tip:** while dragging a window, keyboard shortcuts still work. Use `Mod+1-4`
> to jump to a bookmark or `Mod+A` to go home — your held window comes with you.

Fit-window (`Mod+M`) is the maximize analogue — centers the viewport, resets
zoom to 1.0, and resizes the window to fill the screen. Toggle again to
restore. Fullscreen (`Mod+F`) is a viewport mode, not a window state — any canvas
action (launching an app, navigating) naturally exits it.

| Input                                     | Action                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 3-finger doubletap-swipe                  | Move window                   |
| `Alt` + LMB drag                          | Move window                   |
| `Alt+Shift` + LMB drag                    | Move snapped windows          |
| `Alt` + 3-finger swipe                    | Resize window                 |
| `Alt+Shift` + 3-finger swipe              | Resize snapped window         |
| `Alt` + RMB drag                          | Resize window                 |
| `Alt` + MMB click / `Mod+M`               | Fit window (maximize/restore) |
| `Alt+Shift` + MMB click / `Mod+Shift+M`   | Fit snapped window            |
| `Mod` + 4-finger pinch in / `Mod+Shift+W` | Zoom-to-fit snapped windows   |
| `Alt` + 2-finger pinch in/out             | Fit window                    |
| `Alt` + 3-finger pinch in/out             | Toggle fullscreen             |
| `Mod` + MMB click / `Mod+F`               | Toggle fullscreen             |
| `Mod+Shift` + arrow                       | Nudge window 20px             |

### Infinite background

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e9eb7f7-0c73-4fdd-b7aa-230b8ff0a172

The background is part of the canvas — it scrolls and zooms with the viewport,
not stuck to the screen. This gives spatial awareness when panning.

Three modes (all rendered as shaders internally):

- **`shader`** — procedural GLSL, animated or static. Default is a dot grid. See [docs/shaders.md](docs/shaders.md) to write your own. Bundled shaders live in `extras/wallpapers/{static,animated}/`.
- **`tile`** — any PNG/JPG, tiled infinitely across the canvas.
- **`wallpaper`** — single image stretched to fill viewport (does not scroll/zoom) — a classic desktop wallpaper.

GPU cost rises with how often the background redraws: `wallpaper` renders once and stays; static shaders and tiles redraw on pan/zoom but cache when the viewport is still; animated shaders redraw every frame.

```toml
[background]
type = "shader"
path = "~/.config/driftwm/bg.glsl"
# Or: type = "tile",      path = "~/Pictures/tile.png"
# Or: type = "wallpaper", path = "~/Pictures/wallpaper.jpg"
```

### Window rules

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af603001-9f08-4d42-b50a-0342d06e954b

Match windows by `app_id` and/or `title` (glob patterns) and control
everything: position, size, decoration mode, blur, opacity, pass-through keys, and widget
behavior. All fields are independent and combine freely.

**Widgets**: set `widget = true` to pin a window in place — immovable, below
normal windows, excluded from Alt-Tab. Works for both regular windows and
layer-shell surfaces (e.g. waybar). Use this for clocks, system stats, trays, or
anything you want fixed on the canvas.

```toml
# Frosted-glass terminal
[[window_rules]]
app_id = "Alacritty"
opacity = 0.85
blur = true

# Desktop widget — pinned, borderless
[[window_rules]]
app_id = "my-clock"
position = [50, 50]
widget = true
decoration = "none"
```

> **Tip:** to find a window's `app_id`, check `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/driftwm/state` —
> the `windows` field lists all open windows by their app ID.

See [docs/window_rules.md](window_rules.md) for more details.

### Multi-monitor

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f6cc3a8-a4ed-4d78-80fc-d5a92478c48f

Multiple monitors are independent viewports on the same canvas. An outline on each monitor shows where the
other monitors' viewports are. Cursor crosses between monitors freely; dragged
windows teleport to the target viewport's canvas position.

| Input             | Action                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `Mod+Alt` + arrow | Send window to adjacent output |

### Panels, docks & taskbars

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83c2ad30-fbfa-4cf2-aa47-905826889dcb

Layer shell surfaces (waybar, fuzzel, mako) work as expected. Foreign toplevel
management means your dock/taskbar shows all windows — click one and the
viewport pans to it and centers it. See [`extras/`](extras/) for a fuzzel
window-search script that lets you search and jump to any open window.

### Everything else

- New window placement: in viewport center (default), under cursor, or snapped adjacent to the focused window's cluster
- Click-to-focus (default) or focus-follows-mouse (sloppy focus)
- Session lock (swaylock), idle notify (swayidle/hypridle)
- Screen capture: screencasting (OBS, Firefox, Discord — requires `xdg-desktop-portal` + `xdg-desktop-portal-cosmic` or `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`) and screenshots (grim + slurp)
- 30+ Wayland protocols

## Install

### Fedora (prebuilt binary)

Built on Fedora 43, x86_64 only, requires glibc ≥ 2.39. aarch64 users:
[build from source](#build-from-source).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malbiruk/driftwm/main/install.sh | sudo sh
```

Installs the binary, session wrapper, desktop entry, and shader wallpapers.
Checks for required runtime libraries and tells you what to install if
anything is missing. To uninstall, run with `sudo sh -s uninstall`.

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S driftwm
```

or for latest main:

```bash
yay -S driftwm-git
```

### NixOS / Nix

A `flake.nix` is included. To build:

```bash
nix build
```

For development (provides native deps, uses your system Rust):

```bash
nix develop
cargo build
cargo run
```

To add driftwm as a session in your NixOS config:

```nix
let
  driftwm-flake = builtins.getFlake "github:malbiruk/driftwm";
  driftwm = driftwm-flake.packages.x86_64-linux.default;
in
{
  services.displayManager.sessionPackages = [ driftwm ];
  environment.systemPackages = [ driftwm ];
}
```

### Build from source

Requires Rust 1.88+ (edition 2024).

**Fedora:**

```bash
sudo dnf install libseat-devel libdisplay-info-devel libinput-devel mesa-libgbm-devel libxkbcommon-devel
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt install libseat-dev libdisplay-info-dev libinput-dev libudev-dev libgbm-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev
```

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S libdisplay-info libinput seatd mesa libxkbcommon
```

> **Note:** Ubuntu 24.04 ships Rust 1.75 which is too old. Install via
> [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) instead of `apt install rustc`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/malbiruk/driftwm.git
cd driftwm
cargo build --release
sudo make install
```

### X11 support

X11 apps run through [xwayland-satellite](https://github.com/Supreeeme/xwayland-satellite)
(>= 0.7). driftwm spawns it at startup and exports `DISPLAY=:N` so X11 clients
connect transparently. No extra config needed beyond having the binary in
`$PATH`.

- **Arch:** `sudo pacman -S xwayland-satellite`
- **Fedora:** `sudo dnf install xwayland-satellite`
- **NixOS:** `pkgs.xwayland-satellite`
- **Debian/Ubuntu:** not yet packaged — `cargo install --locked xwayland-satellite`

If satellite isn't found at startup, driftwm logs a warning and continues without
X11 support. You can override the binary path or disable the integration in
[`config.reference.toml`](config.reference.toml) under `[xwayland]`.

> Logs go to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/driftwm.log` when launched by a display manager, otherwise stderr.

### Running

driftwm auto-detects whether it's running nested (inside an existing Wayland
session) or on real hardware (from a TTY). Just run `driftwm`. For display
manager integration, select "driftwm" from the session menu.

## Quick start

`mod` is Super by default. Terminal and launcher are auto-detected (foot/alacritty/kitty, fuzzel/wofi/bemenu); override in config.

| Shortcut           | Action        |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| `mod+return`       | Open terminal |
| `mod+d`            | Open launcher |
| `mod+q`            | Close window  |
| `mod+l`            | Lock screen   |
| `mod+ctrl+shift+q` | Quit          |

Feature-specific bindings (navigation, zoom, snap) are in their respective sections above.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/driftwm/config.toml` (respects `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/driftwm
cp /etc/driftwm/config.reference.toml ~/.config/driftwm/config.toml
```

Missing file uses built-in defaults. Partial configs merge with defaults —
only specify what you want to change. Use `"none"` to unbind a default binding.
Validate without starting: `driftwm --check-config`.

```toml
# Launch programs at startup
autostart = ["waybar", "swaync", "swayosd-server"]
```

See [`config.reference.toml`](config.reference.toml) for all options: input
settings, scroll/momentum tuning, snap behavior, decorations, effects,
per-output config, gesture bindings, mouse bindings, and window rules.

## Example setup

driftwm is just a compositor — everything else is standard Wayland tooling.
Here are some tools that work well with it:

- **waybar** — Status bar / taskbar
- **crystal-dock** — macOS-style dock
- **fuzzel / wofi** — App launcher
- **mako / swaync** — Notifications
- **swaylock** — Lock screen
- **swayidle / hypridle** — Idle timeout (lock, suspend)
- **swayosd** — Volume/brightness OSD
- **grim + slurp** — Screenshots
- **wlr-randr / wdisplays** — Output configuration
- **COSMIC Settings** — Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, sound (or nm-applet + blueman + pavucontrol)

The [`extras/`](extras/) directory contains a complete setup — driftwm config,
GLSL shader wallpapers, Python widgets (clock, calendar, system stats, power
menu), waybar with taskbar/tray, fuzzel window-search script, and window rules
tying it all together. Use it as a starting point or steal pieces.
